# GUI-Based-Firewall
A simple C++-based firewall simulation built using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It features a GUI that allows users to define firewall rules, add network packets, and analyze whether traffic should be allowed or denied based on the rules. Developed as a semester project for CS-112 (Object Oriented Programming).

# Firewall Simulation (C++ OOP Semester Project)

## Overview
This project is a simple firewall simulation application developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to define firewall rules, add network packets, and analyze whether the traffic should be allowed or denied.

## Team Members
- M Shaheer Ali Tarar (232078)
- M Imad Ul Islam (232082)
- Munawar Masood (232932)

## Features
- Login interface to restrict unauthorized access.
- Firewall information and rule definition interface.
- Packet input interface with import options.
- Result comparison showing packet filtering outcomes.
- GUI built with Windows Forms in C++.

## Program Flow
1. **Login Interface**: Secure access via password.
2. **Firewall Info Form**: Basic firewall overview and navigation.
3. **Add Rule Form**: Add, import, or clear firewall rules.
4. **Add Packet Form**: Add, import, or clear network packets.
5. **Result Comparison**: Analyze and display results for each packet.

## Technologies Used
- C++ with OOP principles
- Windows Forms (GUI)

## Testing
Performed unit and integration tests including:
- Password validation
- Rule and packet configuration
- Error handling for incorrect file types
- Packet-rule interaction tests

## Challenges Faced
- Data transfer between multiple Windows Forms
- Text formatting in output result files

## Lessons Learned
- Practical application of OOP in GUI design
- Understanding firewall functionality
- Improved skills in error handling, modularity, and system design

## Future Improvements
- Better UI enhancements
- Real-world firewall rule support
- Integration with networking tools and log export
